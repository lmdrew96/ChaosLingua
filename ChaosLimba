Machine Learning Notebook Goal: Model understands colloquial Romanian and the nuances of the language to a point of being able to distinguish why a user gave the answer that they did and how to point their thinking in the right direction if incorrect.
I've found some really good datasets, but they aren't being used by the kinds of models that I need. And while there are some really good models out there passing multilingual benchmarks, I find myself wanting pared and fine-tuned versions.

Important note: I'm a full-time first gen college student working part-time. I don't have a budget. The cheaper the better. I'm open to more complex suggestions if they're completely free.

I already have both HF and MCD APIs available.
